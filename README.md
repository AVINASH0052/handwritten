## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwriting-recognition.git
    cd handwriting-recognition
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install Jupyter Lab:**

    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```

5. **Install PyTorch:**

    Follow the instructions on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install the appropriate version for your system.

## Usage

1. **Start Jupyter Lab:**

    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

2. **Open the Notebook:**

    In Jupyter Lab, navigate to the `handwriting.ipynb` notebook and open it.

3. **Run the Notebook:**

    Execute the cells in the notebook to train the model and test its performance.
